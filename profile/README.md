# GOTODOCO
#### Your content reimagined and GOTO for exceptional DOCO planning, creation, management and engagement.

An opportunity exists now to improve documentation and content and give them the stage they deserve. 
That is why we are pioneering a new way forward for documentation, content and information. No biggie (_except it is... to us_).
GOTODOCO is designed with intent and created for purpose. It's all about end users for us!

### Our Intent 
We aim to improve how content and information is considered, planned, created and consumed, with the end user always as our focus. 
By doing this We will be your GOTO for continuouos, reliable and validated sources of content, that sets a new standard in end user confidence.

### Our Purpose
To create a continuous and single source of content that caters to all end users, regardless of their age, ability, knowledge, intent, purpose, mood or otherwise.

### Our Ethos
We are a purpose brand,and that means everything we consider, interact or engage with, must always start with consideration, understanding, context and validation, and be driven by an initiative.
