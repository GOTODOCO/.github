# Welcome to GOTODOCO

Your GOTO for exceptional DOCO transformation and continuous, single-source content, concepts and methods. We are pioneering a global initiative to transform the way content is planned, created, managed and consumed. 

We are passionate about DOCO and driven to create a new way forward for content so we encourage you to explore our [website](https://gotodoco.com) to learn more about our intent and purpose. 

## About

GOTODOCO is designed with intent, created with purpose. 
We identify inefficiencies with content and get to work to improve the intent and purpose. 
Itâ€™s all about personas for us!

## A heliopter view

At a high level our framework focusses on four areas: INSIGHT, INTENT, PURPOSE and ENGAGEMENT.

INSIGHT = The understand step! Explore, understand, validate, plan.
INTENT = The WHY for your CONTENT. What is your intention, what do you need to DO with the content and where does it fit in the framework.
PURPOSE = OUTPUT and AUDIENCE. What is the future state, what do you need to ACHIEVE, and WHO is your audience. 
ENGAGEMENT = Is the content fit for purpose, how will your audience CONSUME the content.

At the core of the GOTODOCO framework is the engine, designed and built with knowledge, experience, skills, smarts, tools and a CI/CD motor, to keep the machine fully functioning, serviced and operating with peak performance.
