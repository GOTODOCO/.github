# Welcome to GOTODOCO

Content reimagined and your GOTO for exceptional and continuous DOCO planning, creation, management and engagement.
We are DOCO experts focused on creating a new way forward for content.

We are driving a global initiative to transform content. In particular how it is planned, created, managed and consumed.
No biggie, (_except it is... to us_).

We are passionate about DOCO and driven to create a new way forward for content and encourage you to learm more about our intent and purpose on our [website](https://gotodoco.com).

## About

GOTODOCO is designed with intent, and created with purpose. 
We identify inefficiencies with content and work to improve the intent and purpose. 
Itâ€™s all about personas for us!

## Snapshot

We created a framework around on four important areas: INSIGHT, INTENT, PURPOSE and ENGAGEMENT.

**INSIGHT** = The understand step! Explore, understand, validate, plan.

**INTENT** = The WHY for your CONTENT. What is your intention, what do you need to DO with the content and where does it fit in the framework.

**PURPOSE** = OUTPUT and AUDIENCE. What is the future state, what do you need to ACHIEVE, and WHO is your audience. 

**CONSUMPTION** = In some ways, the most important area: The HOW! Is the content fit for purpose, and how will your audience CONSUME the content.

And at the CORE is the engine. Built with knowledge, experience, skills, smarts, tools and a CI/CD motor, to keep the machine fully functioning, serviced and operating with peak performance.
