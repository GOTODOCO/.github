# Welcome to GOTODOCO

Your GOTO for exceptional DOCO transformation and continuous, single-source content concepts and methods. We are pioneering a global initiative to transform the way content is planned, created, managed and consumed. 

Meet the GOTODOCO sSoT, and our global initiative to create a central and single Source of Truth [G2DsSoT] for popular and re-usable content. 

## Designed with intent, created with purpose.
This GitHub repository exists for approved members, invested, and with an assigned role, to contribute to a new way for content. 
If you have landed here and and want to learn more about our intent and purpose - we encourage you to GO TO the GOTODOCO [website](https://gotodoco.com) for more details.

## Snapshot

At a high level the G2DsSoT is split into three categories: INPUT, OUTPU and ARTICLES.

Think of INPUT as your intent: the building blocks used to create the content with a FUTURE STATE, or PUBLISHED state, (the output). 
The OUTPUT is all about the purpose: the content being created and built using the building blocks [from the input]; who is the audience and why is it needed and being created/published.

ARTICLES are the the core, the bees kneez, the mechanics! 
They are delivered by way of a snapshot, created on a persona, but allowing the end user to interact and consume the content, how and when they want to, AND in a way that THEY decide.
