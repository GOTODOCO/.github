# GOTODOCO
#### Your content reimagined and GOTO for exceptional and continuous DOCO planning, creation, management and engagement.

An opportunity exists now for documentation and information to give it the stage it deserves. 
We are pioneering a new way forward for content, documentation and information. No biggie (_except it is... to us_).

## Get to Know Us
GOTODOCO is designed with intent and created for purpose. 

### Our Intent 
It's all about end users for us! 
Our intent is to improve how content and information is planned, created, managed and consumed.

### Our Purpose
Create a consistent approach to content using curated frameworks, concepts and tools, driven by identified and validated initiatives.

## Meet GOTOSoT
Starting with our first initiative. Meet GOTOSoT... a central GOTO and Source of Truth [SoT] approach for popular supporting files and content, including:

- Articles
- References
- Context
- Information
- Project files
- Packages
- Assets
- Code samples
- Templates
- Data dictionaries

And this is just the beginning! GOTO our [Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/GOTODOCO/projects/13/views/1) to learn more and contribute your ideas.

Are you ready? (_New ways don't create themselves._)
