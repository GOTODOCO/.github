## Overview

An opportunity exists now for documentation and information to give it the stage it deserves. 
We are pioneering a new way forward for content, documentation and information. No biggie (_except it is... to us_).

GOTODOCO is designed with intent and created for purpose. 

## Get to Know Us
### Our Intent 

It's all about end users for us! 
Our intent is to improve how content and information is planned, created, managed and consumed.

### Our Purpose
Create a consistent approach to content using curated frameworks, concepts and tools, driven by identified and validated initiatives.
